# About these notes

These notes are based on a Numerical Analysis course I teach at the Centre for Applicable Mathematics, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bangalore, to first year Integrated-PhD students in applied mathematics. The emphasis is on understanding how the methods are derived, why they work and also implement them in a code.

## Python

The methods discussed in these notes are illustrated with codes written in Python. I will assume that the reader is familiar with Python, in particular Numpy and Matplotlib. For a basic introduction to some Python, read my tutorial here

:::{warning}
The implementations are shown in Python, which may not lead to  fast code, and are only meant to show the ideas. Readers interested in speed    should implement the methods in Fortran/C/C++ or use numerical libraries.
